* Longest/Average/Median dependency path – since build queue for a chain is linear, the shorter the paths, the less time in queue
* Clustering on the graph – find out if companies are clustered the same as artifacts.
* Criticality – find out which code parts are critical (by no. of artifacts dependent on them)
* Stability/Volatility – which code is more/less stable (in terms of being changed, and in terms of builds breaking)
* Link commits to deploys/rollbacks ? Not sure if there is easy way to do it.
* Artifacts by deploys/rollbacks
